The Task:


Create an in memory implementation of IRepository<T> 


Hints:

The solution should be developed in a Test Driven approach, we expect the code you write to have excellent unit test coverage.

Keep the solution simple, we value simple architecture and SOLID principles, but we're not looking for over engineered design.

The code should be self-explanatory, documentation should not be required to understand the code.
